# Why do we exist?
i, the creator quite like hypixel skyblock but due to certain reasons do not play it.
so i decided to make a tiny team and we created this based on skyblock. The grindy part you all love is absolutely still here and a server is 100% on the way.
we are not really experienced in making mods/plugins (as evidenced by the .mcreator folder) so we will likely need help from people who know what they're doing.

our goal with this project is to do our best at avoiding the fails of hypixel team (with update balance and whatnot) making the experience enjoyable to everyone.
Once the server is up the mod will get a custom anticheat update, although we will not disclose how it works to avoid bypasses (secuity by design mixed with security thruogh obscurity lol)

good luck to whoever you are, you are amazing!
